# QuickReadScrapper

This python script is backbone of the iOS app QuickRead (https://github.com/dinoMartan/iOSQuickRead) <br/>
This script runs on my raspberryPi server every 10min. Its main purpose is to go over the given news sites, find articles, summerize the articles and save them to the database. That data is used in iOS app and can be used in a future on other platforms. Adding news sites is done in the database manually because it requires specific site parameters. You can learn more about the database on Ivan Beljan's repo (https://github.com/IvanB475/QuickreadBackend).
